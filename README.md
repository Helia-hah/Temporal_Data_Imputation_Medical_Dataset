# Temporal Data Imputation for Medical Datasets

This repository presents a novel statistical hierarchical approach for imputing missing values in temporal medical datasets. For time series imputation in this research, the following information about ICU patients was extracted from the MIMIC-IV dataset:

- Six routine vital signs: heart rate (**HR**), respiratory rate (**RR**), oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry) (**O2SP**), and non-invasive blood pressureâ€”diastolic (**NIBPD**), mean (**NIBPM**), and systolic (**NIBPS**).
  
- Two Types of Demographic Information: Gender and age.

- Three Physical Characteristics: Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI).

- Administered Medications.


### Data Preprocessing

- (**Outlier Removal:**)Outliers in demographic data, vital signs, and physical characteristics were removed based on the following value ranges:

| Variable | Min Value | Max Value |
|------------------------------|-----------|-----------| 
| **Heart Rate ** | -3 | 303 | 
| **Respiratory Rate ** | -3 | 303 | 
| **Oxygen Saturation ** | -1 | 101 | 
| **Non-invasive BP diastolic ** | -5 | 505 | 
| **Non-invasive BP systolic ** | -5 | 505 | 
| **Non-invasive BP mean ** | -5 | 505 | 
| **Weight** | 40 | 1435 | 
| **Height** | 20 | 110 |
| **BMI** | 5 | 190 |
