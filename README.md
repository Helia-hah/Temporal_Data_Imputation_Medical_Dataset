# Temporal Data Imputation for Medical Datasets

This repository presents a novel statistical hierarchical approach for imputing missing values in temporal medical datasets. For time series imputation in this research, the following information about ICU patients was extracted from the MIMIC-IV [1,2] dataset:

- Six routine vital signs: heart rate (**HR**), respiratory rate (**RR**), oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry) (**O2SP**), and non-invasive blood pressureâ€”diastolic (**NIBPD**), systolic (**NIBPS**), and mean (**NIBPM**).
  
- Two Types of Demographic Information: Gender and age.

- Three Physical Characteristics: Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI).

- Administered Medications.


### Data Preprocessing

- **Outlier Removal:** Outliers in demographic data, vital signs, and physical characteristics were removed based on the following value ranges:
    | Variable                   | Min Value | Max Value |
  |----------------------------|----------|----------|
  | Heart Rate                | -3       | 303      |
  | Respiratory Rate          | -3       | 303      |
  | Oxygen Saturation         | -1       | 101      |
  | Non-invasive BP diastolic | -5       | 505      |
  | Non-invasive BP systolic  | -5       | 505      |
  | Non-invasive BP mean      | -5       | 505      |
  | Weight                    | 40       | 1435     |
  | Height                    | 20       | 110      |
  | BMI                       | 5        | 190      |

- **Timestamp Standardization:**
  - Timestamps for the six vital signs were rounded to the nearest hour with a 30-minute threshold applied (If no record was available for a given time, it was replaced with null values). Data were aggregated at one-hour intervals for consistency across patients.
  - To standardize medication administration timing, start and end times were rounded to the nearest hour using a 30-minute threshold. New records were created for each medication at each rounded hour within the administration period.
 
- **Medication Categorization:** Medications were grouped into 16 main categories and encoded in binary format (1 for received, 0 for not received).
 
- **Physical Characteristics Preprocessing**:
  - Height values were averaged across all stays (All patients were adults, so height changes were negligible).
  - Weight values from the medication table were averaged hourly and smoothed using a 24-hour rolling mean to account for fluctuations. The resulting values were then averaged with weights from the OMR table.
  - Update BMI using the new height and weight values.

### Introducing Missingness
---
Three distinct missingness patterns (Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), Missing Not at Random (MNAR)) and eleven missing data ratios, including 1%, and ranging from 5% to 50% in 5% increments, were applied to each vital sign.
  - To generate MCAR and MNAR, the `produce_NA` function was used, with references to [this guide](https://rmisstastic.netlify.app/how-to/python/generate_html/how%20to%20generate%20missing%20values) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BorisMuzellec/MissingDataOT).
  - The MAR pattern was created by identifying the feature most strongly correlated with the target column. A specified number of missing values were introduced: half were selected from the smallest values and the other half from the largest values of the correlated feature. Finally, the corresponding rows in the target column were set to missing.
