# Temporal_Data_Imputation_Medical_Dataset

This repository presents a novel statistical hierarchical approach for imputing missing values in temporal medical datasets. For time series imputation in this research, the following information about ICU patients was extracted from the MIMIC-IV dataset:

- Six routine vital signs: heart rate (**HR**), respiratory rate (**RR**), oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry) (**O2SP**), and non-invasive blood pressureâ€”diastolic (**NIBPD**), mean (**NIBPM**), and systolic (**NIBPS**).
  
- Two Types of Demographic Information: Gender and age.

- Three Physical Characteristics: Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI).

- Administered Medications.
