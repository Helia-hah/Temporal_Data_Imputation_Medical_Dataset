A variety of models were employed to evaluate the imputation process for medical time series, categorized based on their distinct methodological characteristics as follows:

1) ðŸ§® **Internal Imputation Models**: These models rely solely on the target column for imputation.
- Average and Median: These imputation methods are the most basic strategies, where the respective statistic from the training set is used to fill missing values in the test set.

- Average_H and Median_H: To improve imputation accuracy, we implemented hierarchical approachesâ€”Average_H and Median_Hâ€”that prioritize patient-specific data by imputing missing values in a stepwise manner: first using statistics from the same ICU stay, then from all stays of the same patient, and finally from the overall test set.

- MediTHIM-A and MediTHIM-M:  To preserve temporal integrity, the historical variants MediTHIM-A and MediTHIM-M impute missing values using only past data, first from the same ICU stay, then from the patientâ€™s previous records, and finally from overall training set statistics, ensuring a strictly time-aware imputation process.

  All the above approaches are implemented in the statistical_impute.py file. Here, `stat_impute` corresponds to Average/Median, `stat_hier_impute` to Average-H/Median-H, and `stat_hier_hist_impute` to MediTHIM-A/MediTHIM-M.

2) ðŸ”— **Feature-Dependent Imputation Models**: These methods use other features within the dataset to predict missing values in the target column.
- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbour
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- MICE [1]

3) ðŸ”„ **Multivariate Imputation Models**: These models leverage both the target feature and other variables within the dataset to perform imputation. In the context of time series data, deep learning approachesâ€”particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)â€”have gained significant popularity.
- GRU-D [2]
- BRITS [3]
  
  All of the above approaches are implemented in rnn_based_impute.py. You can specify the model by setting the 'rnn_model' variable to either brits or grud.
