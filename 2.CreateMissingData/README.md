### Introducing Missingness
---
To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach, eleven missing data ratios were applied to each vital sign—specifically 1%, and from 5% to 50% in 5% increments. Additionally, three distinct missingness patterns—Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), and Missing Not at Random (MNAR)—were introduced for each vital sign.
